  - The VeganHealth site is the single most helpful resource I've found (and something I have come back and
    referenced numerous times). This "daily needs" page from VeganHealth is a great
    summary of their recommendations, with links to further reading if interested. They
    also have a pretty nice [page](https://veganhealth.org/tips-for-new-vegans/) with
    "tips for new vegans."
  - This is also probably the resource I trust the most. Their recommendations seem
    clear-headed and strongly driven by the literature. One of the main authors on the
    site, Jack Norris, is a registered dietician and seems very committed to promoting the
    spread of veganism. Due to this goal, I get the impression that he doesn't try to
    sugarcoat nutritional advice, but instead does his best to give sound advice since
    this is what will make veganism sustainable for his readers.
