## Purpose and Limitations
I’m planning to take some time to think over cause prioritization in order to
decide which cause areas are most impactful for me to contribute to. I’d like to
be thorough and rigorous. I believe that being right or wrong about these
questions will very significantly affect how much positive impact I can have
with my life. Thus, I think these are among the most important questions I could
try to answer. However, I'm doing this alongside a full-time job in the context
of an already busy life. Therefore, I aim to be practical and efficient with
this process. Many of the individual sub-questions I'm mulling over could
probably be thought about and investigated for decades. For now, there are many
stones I'll need to leave unturned. Unfortunately, this means that many of the
investigations will likely feel rushed or unsatisfactory. Nonetheless,
these considerations will hopefully serve as a solid foundation and starting
point. I imagine I’ll be refining these ideas over the course of many years, or
even decades.
