## Effectiveness
In the last several months, many sources have been urging people to
call their elected officials to demand they work towards things like
immediate ceasefire and humanitarian aid in Palestine, along with the
withholding of weapons shipments to Israel. Recently, I've wondered
how effective calls to representatives are. From some brief reading,
it seems like effectiveness widely ranges, from being significantly
impactful to having no impact, depending on the specifics of the
situation. For example, one official was quoted saying they wouldn't
change their policy stance, no matter how many constituents called
their office with opposing views (this wasn't related to Palestine or
Israel).

Calling can powerfully nudge officials in the desired direction, under
certain conditions, such as:
1. the official is soon up for re-election & the official believes
   they could jeopardize their chances at winning re-election by not
   heeding the messages of the calls they're receiving
2. the issue is not a hotly contested one
3. the issue IS a hotly contested one, but a critical mass of people
  have spoken up about it in the official's district, such that
  condition #1 applies

Based on these conditions, I think now is a key time when calling your
officials for Palestine could have high impact, especially if your
official is up for re-election. The call to support Palestine is
becoming louder and louder, and if your official is up for
re-election, you can help make it clear to them that this an issue
they can't ignore without hurting their re-election chances.

## Approach
I came across some of the below tips for calling officials, which I found useful.

1. Add 6 contacts to your phone: the local & DC phone numbers for your
   2 senators and 1 House representative for your district (i.e. 2
   numbers for each of your 3 officials).
    - Prefix the names of these contacts with something distinct, so
      that you can easily search for them when you're calling officials.
      - e.g. "EO - Sen Durbin DC Office" (EO for elected official,
        then search for "EO when wanting to see all the numbers of
        your officials)
    - When reading, I came across multiple examples of people who make
      6 calls to their officials everyday -- one to each of these
      numbers. To be transparent, I don't plan on being able to
      maintain this level of commitment, but I find it inspiring and a
      good example of the level to which you can take this. Find what
      works for you and feels like a good level of contribution.
2. Come up with your own scripts for the issues you care about (vs.
   using templates / scripts).
  - Yes, this takes more time, but it's been found that officials
    often heed personal stories and messages more than templates,
    scripts, etc. used on a mass scale. I.e. if an office gets 100
    calls with the exact same script used, generally, each call has
    less weight vs. if unique scripts were used.
  - Luckily, this is an upfront investment that will pay off, as the
    script can ideally be repeatedly re-used within the same topic /
    issue. 
  - This is purely my own 2 cents -- ie not verified with other
    sources -- but my guess is that it's best to keep the script as
    clear, concise, and short as possible. The person taking your call
    has to relay the message to the official, and as the length of
    your message increases, my guess is that each additional word
    carries less weight / is less likely to be relayed to the
    official. Imagine if you were taking notes to relay to an
    official. The most supportive message for this task is one that
    has clear, succint points that can be easily repeated to another
    person. It would also have the main points pruned and prioritized
    so that the most important messages get highlighted, rather than a
    laundry list of any point you could make about the topic.
  - Introduce yourself (name) and state that you're a constituent of
    the given official.
  - Again, this is just my own 2 cents, but I like ending the message
    by saying something like "I look forward to seeing how [official's
    name] will respond to this critical moment." It feels like this
    makes explicit the fact that your eyes are on your representative
    and that you'll take stock of their response come time to vote.
3. Be sure to give your zip code if a staffer answers the phone. If
   you're leaving a voice mail, I've heard that it's best to give your
   full street address. If you don't, they might not log your call and
   tally your message since they have to verify that you live within
   the official's district.
4. Educate yourself. It's good to not put too high of a standard on
   yourself here -- i.e. you don't have to be an expert to call your
   official -- but your call will be more effective if you know enough
   to make informed points (which of course is, in itself, a valuable
   thing). Calls that sound uninformed are much more likely to be
   dismissed by the staffer and sway the official less.
  - As part of this, try to educate yourself on what your official's
    existing stances are on the issues you're calling about. E.g. if you're
    calling about a ceasefire in Palestine and your official has
    already repeatedly made public demands for this, you might have a
    different message for them than if they've been silent. You may
    want to thank them and urge them to keep up this effort.
5. If you feel nervous about making a call and having a live staffer
   answer, that's OK -- you got this :). You could start by calling
   outside of business hours, when you'll just be prompted to leave a
   message. Then, once you're comfortable with this, you can try
   calling during business hours and get used to giving your message
   to a live staffer. Remember, they receive calls everyday and, if
   you give some attention and care to your message, there's a decent
   chance you'll be one of the more thoughtful, informed callers they
   get that day.
